## I - What

This is Noir attempt at making some short of [commonplace book](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book). Though, Noir do it digitally instead, in the form of hypertext documents. There would be no navigation nor chronological list of things. As wikipedia said;

> [Hypertext](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress set, or screen touch.

## II - Why

Have heard of [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/) or [Second Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Second-Brain-Organize-Potential/dp/1982167386)? Noir fall into that rabbit hole once, especially since Noir use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) myself. Noir tried it, Noir watched every YouTube video about it. The one who stick the most is the Digital Garden one. The concept is close to what Noir have now.

But Noir's is not collection of "ideas", more like loosely linked "knowledge" and "notes" about things. Perhaps, it's close to a personal encyclopedia, which in Noir opinion, is what commonplace book is.

## III - How

The content itself is managed using Obsidian. [Here is a note about Noir's obsidian setup](/20250211-02). Meanwhile, the site is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). [Noir also have some notes about it](/20250211-03).

## IV - Who

Noir just someone who likes coding([GitHub](https://github.com/noirelle))and writing([Tumblr](https://nouralie.tumblr.com)). Noir believe [software should be simple (architecturally and aesthetically), minimal and long-lived](#) and that [you should learn by making your own wheel](#).
